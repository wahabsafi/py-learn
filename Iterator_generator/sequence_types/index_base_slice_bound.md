I'd be glad to provide a comprehensive explanation of index base and slice bounds in Python:

**Index Base**

* Python uses **0-based indexing**, meaning the first element in a sequence has an index of 0. This is a common convention in many programming languages.
* For example, in a list `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`, the element `1` is at index 0, `2` is at index 1, and `3` is at index 2.

**Slice Bounds**

* Slicing is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to extract subsequences from a sequence.
* A slice is specified using three parameters: `start`, `stop`, and `step`.
* `start`: The index of the first element to include in the slice. If omitted, it defaults to 0.
* `stop`: The index of the first element *not* to include in the slice. If omitted, it defaults to the length of the sequence.
* `step`: The step size between elements in the slice. If omitted, it defaults to 1.

**Examples:**

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Extract elements from index 1 to 3 (excluding index 3)
sublist1 = my_list[1:3]  # Output: [2, 3]

# Extract elements from the beginning to index 2 (excluding index 2)
sublist2 = my_list[:2]  # Output: [1, 2]

# Extract elements from index 2 to the end
sublist3 = my_list[2:]  # Output: [3, 4, 5]

# Extract every other element starting from index 1
sublist4 = my_list[1::2]  # Output: [2, 4]

# Extract elements in reverse order
sublist5 = my_list[::-1]  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

**Key Points:**

* The `start` and `stop` indices are always inclusive and exclusive, respectively.
* If `step` is negative, the slice is created in reverse order.
* You can omit any of the `start`, `stop`, or `step` parameters to use default values.

By understanding index base and slice bounds, you can effectively manipulate sequences in Python and extract the desired subsequences.
