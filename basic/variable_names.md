Python variable names follow specific rules to ensure clarity and readability:

**General Rules:**

- **Start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).**
- **Consist of letters, numbers, and underscores.**
- **Cannot be a reserved keyword (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`).**
- **Case-sensitive (e.g., `myVar` and `myvar` are different).**
- **Use meaningful names that reflect the variable's purpose.**

**Best Practices:**

- **Use lowercase letters for variable names.**
- **Separate words with underscores (e.g., `my_variable`).**
- **Avoid using single-letter variable names (except for common loop counters like `i`, `j`, `k`).**
- **Be consistent with your naming style throughout your code.**

**Common Naming Conventions:**

- **CamelCase:** Each word starts with a capital letter (e.g., `myVariable`).
- **snake_case:** Words are separated by underscores (e.g., `my_variable`).

**Examples:**

```python
# Valid variable names:
name = "Alice"
age = 30
is_student = True
my_variable = 10

# Invalid variable names:
123_variable  # Starts with a number
my-variable  # Contains a hyphen
if  # Reserved keyword
```

**Additional Tips:**

- **Avoid using reserved keywords to avoid potential conflicts.**
- **Use meaningful names to make your code more readable and understandable.**
- **Be consistent with your naming style to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout your code.**

By following these guidelines, you can create well-structured and readable Python code.
