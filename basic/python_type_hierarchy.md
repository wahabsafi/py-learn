Python's type hierarchy is a fundamental concept in the language that defines the relationships between different data types. It helps in understanding how objects are created, accessed, and manipulated.

**Core Types:**

At the base of the hierarchy are the core types, which represent the fundamental data types in Python:

* **Numeric Types:**
    * `int`: Integers (e.g., 1, -10, 0)
    * `float`: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5)
    * `complex`: Complex numbers (e.g., 2+3j)
* **Sequence Types:**
    * `list`: Ordered collection of elements (e.g., [1, "hello", 3.14])
    * `tuple`: Immutable ordered collection of elements (e.g., (1, "hello", 3.14))
    * `str`: Sequence of characters (e.g., "hello")
* **Mapping Types:**
    * `dict`: Unordered collection of key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 30})
* **Set Types:**
    * `set`: Unordered collection of unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3})
    * `frozenset`: Immutable set (e.g., frozenset({1, 2, 3}))
* **Boolean Type:**
    * `bool`: Represents True or False values

**Object Orientation:**

Python is an object-oriented programming language, and all data types in Python are objects. This means they have attributes and methods associated with them.

* **Attributes:** These are the characteristics or properties of an object. For example, a `list` object has attributes like `length` and `index`.
* **Methods:** These are the functions that can be called on an object to perform specific operations. For example, a `list` object has methods like `append`, `remove`, and `sort`.

**Inheritance:**

Python supports inheritance, which allows you to create new classes (types) based on existing classes. This promotes code reuse and modularity.

* **Parent Class:** The original class from which a new class is derived.
* **Child Class:** The new class that inherits properties and methods from the parent class.

**Type Hierarchy:**

The type hierarchy in Python can be visualized as a tree structure, where the core types are at the root and derived classes form the branches.

```
Object
  |
  +-- int
  +-- float
  +-- complex
  +-- str
  +-- list
  +-- tuple
  +-- dict
  +-- set
  +-- frozenset
  +-- bool
  +-- ... (other built-in types)
  +-- User-defined classes
```

**Type Checking:**

Python is dynamically typed, which means the type of a variable is determined at runtime. However, you can use type hints to provide optional type information for variables and functions. This can improve code readability and maintainability.

**Key Points:**

* Python's type hierarchy is based on objects and inheritance.
* Core types are the fundamental building blocks of data in Python.
* Attributes and methods define the behavior of objects.
* Inheritance allows for code reuse and modularity.
* Python is dynamically typed, but type hints can be used for better code clarity.

By understanding Python's type hierarchy, you can write more efficient and maintainable code.
