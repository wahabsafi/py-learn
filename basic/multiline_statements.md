**Multiline Statements:**

- **Implicit Line Continuation:** Python automatically continues a statement to the next line if it ends with a comma or parentheses. This is useful for creating more readable code, especially when dealing with long lists or dictionaries.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3,
            4, 5, 6]

my_dict = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
```

- **Explicit Line Continuation:** Use the backslash character (`\`) to explicitly indicate that a statement should continue on the next line. This is useful for breaking up long statements or aligning code for better readability.

```python
long_string = "This is a very long string that " \
              "spans multiple lines."

result = complex_calculation(a, b, c,
                             d, e, f)
```

**Multiline Strings:**

- **Triple Quotes:** Use triple quotes (either single `'''` or double `"""`) to create multiline strings that can span multiple lines without the need for backslashes. This is commonly used for docstrings, long text blocks, or formatted output.

```python
docstring = """This is a multiline docstring.
It can span multiple lines without using backslashes."""

formatted_output = f"""
Hello, {name}!
You are {age} years old.
"""
```

**Key Points:**

- Python's automatic line continuation feature simplifies writing multiline statements.
- The backslash character can be used for explicit line continuation.
- Triple quotes provide a convenient way to create multiline strings.
- Choose the appropriate method based on your code's readability and requirements.

By understanding these techniques, you can effectively write and format multiline statements and strings in Python, making your code more organized and easier to read.
