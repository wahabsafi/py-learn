**Variable Reassignment:**

In Python, you can change the value of a variable at any time by assigning a new value to it. This process is known as variable reassignment.

**Example:**

```python
x = 10
print(x)  # Output: 10

x = 20
print(x)  # Output: 20
```

In this example, the variable `x` is initially assigned the value 10. Later, it is reassigned the value 20. The previous value (10) is no longer associated with the variable.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Mutable vs. Immutable Types:**
    - **Mutable types:** When you reassign a variable that refers to a mutable object (like a list or dictionary), the variable will now point to a different object, but the original object may still be accessible.
    - **Immutable types:** When you reassign a variable that refers to an immutable object (like a number, string, or tuple), a new object is created with the new value, and the old object is discarded.

- **Variable Scope:** The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed. Reassigning a variable within its scope will affect its value within that scope.

**Example with Mutable and Immutable Types:**

```python
# Mutable type (list)
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

my_list = [4, 5, 6]
print(my_list)  # Output: [4, 5, 6]

# Immutable type (string)
my_string = "hello"
print(my_string)  # Output: hello

my_string = "world"
print(my_string)  # Output: world
```

In the example above, reassigning `my_list` creates a new list object and the old list object remains accessible. However, reassigning `my_string` creates a new string object and the old string object is no longer accessible.

**Conclusion:**

Variable reassignment is a fundamental concept in Python that allows you to change the values of variables dynamically. Understanding the differences between mutable and immutable types is important when working with variable reassignment.
