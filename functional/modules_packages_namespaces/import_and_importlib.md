I'd be glad to provide a comprehensive explanation of `import` and `importlib` in Python:

**`import` Statement:**

- **Purpose:** The `import` statement is the primary mechanism for importing modules in Python. It allows you to access the definitions and statements contained within a module.
- **Syntax:**
  - `import module_name` (imports the entire module)
  - `from module_name import function_name, class_name, ...` (imports specific objects from the module)
  - `from module_name import *` (imports all objects from the module, not recommended in general due to potential naming conflicts)
- **Search Path:** When you import a module, Python searches for it in the directories specified in the `sys.path` list. This list typically includes the current working directory, the standard library directory, and any additional directories you've added using `sys.path.append()`.
- **Module Loading:** If the module is found, Python loads its code and makes its definitions available for use in your script.

**`importlib` Module:**

- **Purpose:** The `importlib` module provides more advanced features for importing modules and managing modules at runtime. It offers finer control over the import process and allows you to customize how modules are loaded and resolved.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `import_module(name)`: Imports a module by its name.
  - `reload_module(module)`: Reloads a previously imported module, allowing you to make changes to the module's code without restarting the program.
  - `find_loader(name)`: Finds the loader associated with a module.
  - `invalidate_caches()`: Invalidates the module cache, forcing Python to reload modules the next time they are imported.
- **Custom Loaders:** You can create custom loaders to implement alternative import mechanisms or to customize how modules are loaded based on specific criteria.

**Comparison:**

| Feature | `import` | `importlib` |
|---|---|---|
| Basic import functionality | Yes | Yes |
| Advanced import control | No | Yes |
| Custom loaders | No | Yes |
| Reloading modules | Limited (restarting the program) | Yes |

**Example:**

```python
import math

print(math.pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793

import importlib

# Reload the math module
importlib.reload(math)

# Access a new definition added to the math module
print(math.tau)  # Output: 6.283185307179586
```

In summary, `import` is the fundamental mechanism for importing modules in Python, while `importlib` provides more advanced features and flexibility for module management. Choose the appropriate method based on your specific needs and the level of control you require over the import process.
