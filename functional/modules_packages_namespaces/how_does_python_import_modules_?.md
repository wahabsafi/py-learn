**Python's Module Import Mechanism**

When you import a module in Python, the interpreter follows a specific process to locate and load the module's code:

1. **Search the Built-in Modules:** Python first checks if the module is one of the built-in modules that are part of the standard library. If found, the module's code is loaded directly.

2. **Search the sys.path Directories:** If the module is not built-in, Python searches for it in the directories listed in the `sys.path` variable. This variable contains a list of directories that Python will search for modules.

   * **Current Directory:** The first directory in `sys.path` is usually the current working directory. This means that modules in the same directory as your script can be imported simply by using their name without specifying a path.
   * **Standard Library Path:** Python also adds the standard library directory to `sys.path`, allowing you to import modules from the standard library without specifying a path.
   * **User-Defined Paths:** You can add additional directories to `sys.path` using the `sys.path.append()` method. This allows you to import modules from custom locations.

3. **Load the Module:** Once the module is found, Python loads its code into memory. The module's code is executed, and its definitions and statements become available for use in your script.

**Example:**

```python
import math

print(math.pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793
```

In this example, Python first checks if `math` is a built-in module. If not, it searches for the `math` module in the directories listed in `sys.path`. Once found, Python loads the `math` module and makes its functions and constants available for use.

**Additional Notes:**

* **Relative Imports:** You can use relative imports to import modules from other modules within the same package. Relative imports use a dot notation to specify the relative path to the module.
* **Package Structure:** Python supports a package structure, which allows you to organize modules into hierarchical directories.
* **__init__.py Files:** Packages must contain an `__init__.py` file to indicate that they are packages. This file can be empty, but it is required.

By understanding how Python imports modules, you can effectively organize and reuse code in your Python projects.
