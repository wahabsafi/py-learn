The `operator` module in Python provides functions corresponding to various built-in operators. This allows you to use operators as functions, which can be useful in certain scenarios, such as when you need to pass a function as an argument to another function.

**Common Operators and Their Corresponding Functions:**

| Operator | Corresponding Function |
|---|---|
| `+` | `operator.add(x, y)` |
| `-` | `operator.sub(x, y)` |
| `*` | `operator.mul(x, y)` |
| `/` | `operator.truediv(x, y)` |
| `//` | `operator.floordiv(x, y)` |
| `%` | `operator.mod(x, y)` |
| `**` | `operator.pow(x, y)` |
| `<` | `operator.lt(x, y)` |
| `>` | `operator.gt(x, y)` |
| `<=` | `operator.le(x, y)` |
| `>=` | `operator.ge(x, y)` |
| `==` | `operator.eq(x, y)` |
| `!=` | `operator.ne(x, y)` |
| `and` | `operator.and_(x, y)` |
| `or` | `operator.or_(x, y)` |
| `not` | `operator.not_(x)` |

**Example:**

```python
import operator

x = 10
y = 5

result = operator.add(x, y)
print(result)  # Output: 15

result = operator.mul(x, y)
print(result)  # Output: 50
```

**Key Points:**

- The `operator` module provides functions for common arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
- Using these functions can sometimes make your code more readable or allow you to pass operators as arguments to other functions.
- The functions in the `operator` module are equivalent to their corresponding built-in operators.

**Additional Functions:**

The `operator` module also provides functions for other operations, such as:

- `itemgetter`: Gets an item from an iterable by its index.
- `attrgetter`: Gets an attribute from an object.
- `methodcaller`: Calls a method on an object.

By using the `operator` module, you can write more concise and expressive code, especially when working with functions that require operators as arguments.
