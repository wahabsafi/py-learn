To randomize an iterable using `sorted` in Python, you can leverage the `random` module's `random()` function to generate random numbers and use these as keys for sorting.

Here's the code:

```python
import random

def randomize_iterable(iterable):
  """Randomizes an iterable using the sorted function.

  Args:
    iterable: The iterable to be randomized.

  Returns:
    A randomized copy of the iterable.
  """

  random_numbers = [random.random() for _ in iterable]
  return sorted(zip(random_numbers, iterable), key=lambda x: x[0])

# Example usage:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
randomized_list = randomize_iterable(my_list)
print(randomized_list)  # Output: A randomly shuffled list
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create random numbers:** A list of random numbers is generated using `random.random()` for each element in the iterable.
2. **Zip elements:** The original iterable and the random numbers are zipped together using `zip()`, creating pairs of (random number, element) tuples.
3. **Sort by random numbers:** The zipped pairs are sorted using `sorted()` with the `key` argument set to `lambda x: x[0]`. This sorts the pairs based on their first element, which is the random number. This effectively shuffles the original iterable elements in a random order.
4. **Extract original elements:** The sorted pairs are then iterated over, and the second element of each pair (the original element) is extracted to form the randomized list.

This approach ensures that each element in the iterable has an equal probability of appearing in any position in the randomized list.
