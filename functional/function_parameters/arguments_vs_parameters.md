**Arguments vs. Parameters in Python**

While the terms "arguments" and "parameters" are often used interchangeably in Python, there is a subtle distinction between them:

**Parameters:**

- **Declared in the function definition:** Parameters are the variables declared within the parentheses of a function definition. They represent the values that the function expects to receive as input.
- **Placeholder:** They act as placeholders for the actual values that will be passed to the function when it is called.

**Arguments:**

- **Passed during function call:** Arguments are the actual values that are passed to a function when it is called. They correspond to the parameters declared in the function definition.

**Example:**

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Parameters: name
greet("Alice")  # Arguments: "Alice"
```

In this example:

- `name` is a parameter declared in the `greet` function definition.
- `"Alice"` is an argument passed to the `greet` function when it is called.

**Key Points:**

- Parameters are defined within the function, while arguments are provided when the function is called.
- The number and types of arguments must match the parameters declared in the function definition.
- Python supports positional arguments, keyword arguments, and default arguments, which provide different ways to pass arguments to functions.

By understanding the difference between arguments and parameters, you can write more clear and concise Python code.
