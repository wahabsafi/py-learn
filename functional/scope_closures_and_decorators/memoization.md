**Memoization** is a technique used to optimize recursive functions by caching their results. It avoids redundant calculations by storing the results of function calls and reusing them when the same arguments are encountered again.

**How it works:**

1. **Cache initialization:** A cache (usually a dictionary) is created to store the results of function calls.
2. **Check for cached result:** Before executing the function, the cache is checked for an existing result corresponding to the current arguments.
3. **Return cached result:** If a cached result exists, it is returned immediately without re-calculating the function.
4. **Calculate and cache:** If no cached result exists, the function is executed, and its result is stored in the cache for future use.

**Benefits of Memoization:**

- **Improved performance:** By avoiding redundant calculations, memoization can significantly improve the performance of recursive functions, especially for functions that are called with the same arguments multiple times.
- **Reduced resource consumption:** Memoization can also help reduce memory usage by avoiding unnecessary intermediate calculations.

**Example:**

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# With memoization
def fibonacci_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        result = n
    else:
        result = fibonacci_memo(n-1, memo) + fibonacci_memo(n-2, memo)
    memo[n] = result
    return result

# Test
print(fibonacci(10))  # Without memoization, can be slow for large n
print(fibonacci_memo(10))  # With memoization, much faster
```

In this example, the `fibonacci_memo` function uses memoization to cache the results of previous calls, significantly improving its performance for larger values of `n`.

**Key Points:**

- Memoization is a technique for optimizing recursive functions.
- It involves caching function results to avoid redundant calculations.
- Memoization can significantly improve performance for functions that are called with the same arguments multiple times.
- The cache can be implemented using a dictionary or other suitable data structure.

By understanding and applying memoization, you can optimize the performance of your recursive functions and make your Python code more efficient.
